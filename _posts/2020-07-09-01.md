## Official Arduino blog!
It was 5 years ago that I was connecting my first led to an Arduino and making it blink.  
I never would have thought there would be a blog post about one of my projects.

I am so happy and excited to see it and can't wait to see where we take it from here.

Thank you Arduino!
