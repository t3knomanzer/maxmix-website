## Maxmix on Amazon!

Many of you have requested being able to purchase pre-built units. This is something we were not originally considering, given that the project is still in the **prototype** phase and it's not ready for production.  

However, given the demand, we have decided to build a small batch of 30 devices and we are very excited to offer this to you.

This batch comes in the beautiful Barcelona Black, uses hardware R97 and it's being sold through Amazon. Initially it will be exclusively available in the USA, we will consider world-wide shipping at a later date.  

Go get it while you can and enjoy it!
