## Release 0.10.3

Some users reported the firmware installer not working with arduinos using the new bootloader.  
This release adds an option to the firmware installer to select between the old and new bootloader.

Go download it [Release 0.10.3](https://github.com/t3knomanzer/maxmix-software/releases/download/0.10.3/Maxmix.0.10.3.msi) or let the auto-updater take care of it for you next time you launch the application.
